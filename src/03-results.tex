\section{Results}
We pruned a four years old virtual
untrained tree (shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:my_figure4}) by using the proposed method and
compared the results to the pruning performed by horticulture expert.
The tree training teaching environment EduAPPLE \cite{kohek_eduapple:_2015} was used for
this purpose. The expert shaped the tree into two primary forms, a
pyramidal growing form (denoted as HeP -- Human expert - Pyramidal), which is similar to a Slender Spindle, and a
growing form Flatt (denoted as HeF -- Human expert - Flatt), suitable for the Fruiting Wall planting system. 
For the automated pruning, we used a cone with the height of \(3\)m and the
opening angle of \(45{^\circ}\) (denoted as DDECn -- DDE method, Conical initial shape), and a cylinder with a height of
3m and radius of 0.75 m (denoted as DDECy -- DDE method, Cylindrical initial shape). 
In both cases, we set \(s_{\mathrm{\max}}=50\).

    \label{fig:my_figure4}
\end{figure}

In all four cases, the light distribution inside the tree crown has
improved (see Table~\ref{tab:light}) as compared to the unpruned tree (Fig.~\ref{fig:my_figure5}) \bb{with the average increase of 168\% of buds}. 
In particular, only 14.89 \% of buds receive more than 70 \% of available light in the unpruned trees, 
while in the the human-pruned tree the amount of such buds increases to 26.80 \% (HeP) and to the 22.95 \% (HeF).
The light distributions of the automated tree pruning are comparable with
that of human expert (25,93 \% for DDECn and 24.18 \% for DDECy). 
When comparing HeP to DDECn the result in the cases of human pruning is slightly better but in the case of HeF and DDECy the automated pruning achieved better result, although the difference in both casses is less than 1.3 \%.

\label{tab:light}
\end{table}


The difference between the DDE and human pruning is also visible in the category of the internodes left in the tree after the pruning as shown in Table~\ref{tab:inodes}.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |l|c|c| } 
 \hline
 \textbf{Method} &  ofinternodes on the tree  & $\Delta$ to unpruned [\%] \\ 
  \hline
 \textbf{Unpruned}            & 14.89 & 0 \\ 
 \hline
 \textbf{Manual Expert (HeP)} & 26.80 & 180 \\ 
 \textbf{Manual Expert (HeF)} & 22.95 & 154 \\ 
  \hline
 \textbf{Automatic (DDECn)} & 25.93 & 174 \\ 
 \textbf{Automatic (DDECy)} & 24.18 & 162 \\ 
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{The percentage of buds receiving more than 70\% of light in an unpruned tree and after manual pruning by using HeP and HeF methods and our automatic pruning by using DDECn and DDECy. The improvement in all cases is in average of 168\%. }
\label{tab:inodes}
\end{table}


By combining both results, it can be concluded, that the human expert
achieved similar bud light exposure with less biomass removed,
which is desirable since the higher number of internodes with
well-illuminated buds represent the higher potential for the yield of
both increased quality and quantity. Another metric is to compare the
percentage of buds in the tree crown receiving more than 40 \% of light
available. In this case, the difference between automated and human
pruning is 0.87 \%, in the case of HeP and DDECn and 6.86 \% by methods HeL and DDECy in the favour of the later.

exposure of buds signify better results.}

\end{figure}

DDECn and DDECy are representative of the selective pruning, where the
results of the first step represent the result of pruning by the
automatic pruning systems currently used. The difference between the
first and second step of DDECn and DDECy can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:my_figure6}.

second pruning step, a) DDECn method, b) DDECy method}

We also wanted to evaluate a long-term exposure to pruning and we were
curious if the proposed automated tree pruning method is capable of tree
training into desired growing form without human intervention. We have
simulated a row of five trees for six consecutive years. At the
beginning of each year, the trees were pruned by DDECn method to shape
them into the Slender Spindle growing form. The starting cone height was
1m and was linearly increased to 2.5m, which was the target height for
the trees in the following three years. The opening angle was constant
at 45Â° for the experiment duration. The initial value of the parameter
\(s_{\mathrm{\max}}\) was set to 20 and was linearly increased to 70 in
the sixth year. The result of the experiment can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:my_figure7}.

Spindle growing form for six consecutive years with the DDECn method.

    \label{fig:my_figure7}
\end{figure}


In general, as the tree structure becomes more complex in time, so the
value of \(s_{\mathrm{\max}}\ \)has to be increased. In our experiments,
we determined, that \(s_{\mathrm{\max}}\ \)should not exceed 150 even
for older trees.
